# A CAN library for the MCP2515 family of external CAN controllers.
**Note:** Although this library was written to build with the rp2350 / raspberry pico2, the library can easily be ported to other platforms by rewriting the platform specific abstractions in the platform/ directiories and changing the CMakeLists.
